# About Limeade

Limeade is a theme for Sublime Text 2 that replaces the Chrome-style tabs used in the default theme with more Mac native-looking tabs. Much of the theme aside from the tabs was based on [Soda Theme](https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme) which you can find [here](https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme).

## Installation using Git

Go to your Sublime Text 2 `Packages` directory and clone the theme repository using the command below:

    git clone https://github.com/trosage/Limeade/ "Theme - Limeade"

### Download Manually

* Download the files using the GitHub .zip download option
* Unzip the files and rename the folder to `Theme - Limeade`
* Copy the folder to your Sublime Text 2 `Packages` directory

## Using Limeade

To configure Sublime Text 2 to use Limeade:

* For Sublime Text 2 (Build 2174) and later - Open your User Settings Preferences file `Sublime Text 2 -> Preferences -> Settings - User`. For earlier builds - Open your User Global Settings Preferences file `Sublime Text 2 -> Preferences -> Global Settings - User`

### Example User Settings

    {
        "theme": "Limeade.sublime-theme"
    }

## Other Considerations

Because much of this theme was based on the [Soda Theme](https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme), it contains some icons from the [Pictos](http://pictos.drewwilson.com/) icon set by Drew Wilson. Any use of these icons, other than for the purpose of the theme itself, would need to comply with Drew's [icon licensing agreement](http://stockart.drewwilson.com/license/).
